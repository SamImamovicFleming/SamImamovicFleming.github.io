  <h2> About Me </h2> 

  <p>I am a currently a student at Fleming College in the <a href="https://flemingcollege.ca/programs/geographic-information-systems-applications-specialist">GIS Program</a>. In addition, I am a recent grad of University of Toronto, where I obtained a Bachelor's of Science majoring in ecology and evolutionary biology. My main focus during my studies was ecology, where I completed a undergraduate thesis in community ecology. </p>  
  
  <p> Before going to univeristy I grew up in the North end of Peterborough. Where I lived with my mom, sister, and grandparents. This meant I grew up in a multigenerational household which only <a href="https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/89-28-0001/2018001/article/00011-eng.htm?wbdisable=true">6.3%</a> of all households in Canada are of this type. I think this should he higher!  
  
  <p> During my free time I like to watch television series, biking, and reading. I really only have one hobby and that is pinning insects. I originally learned to pin insect by taking an entomolgy field course, and then kept pinning insects on my free time. Their is quite literally millions of species of insects right in your backyard and pinning insects is kinda of like playing pokemon, you got to catch them all! </p>
